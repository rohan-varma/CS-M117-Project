### CS M117 Project

### Instructions for running front-end: 

1) Clone the repository and navigate into the front-end directory and run `npm install`
2) Once that is finished, you should be able to run the command `react-native run-ios` (mac only) which will launch the front end in an iPhone simulator.

Please see README in backend folder for backend instructions.
